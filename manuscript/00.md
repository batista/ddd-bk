# Introduction

Over the last years, I've helped numerous companies with implementing large-scale enterprise applications with Angular. 

One vital aspect here is decomposing the system into smaller libraries to reduce complexity. However, if this results in countless small libraries which are too intermingled, you haven't exactly made progress. If everything depends on everything else, you can't easily change or extend your system without breaking other parts. 

Domain-driven design, especially strategic design, helps. Also, strategic design can be the foundation for building micro frontends.

This book, which builds on several of my blogposts about Angular, DDD, and micro frontends, explains how to use these ideas.

## Thanks

I want to thank several people who have helped me write this book:

- [Thomas Burleson](https://twitter.com/thomasburleson?lang=de) who did an excellent job describing the concept of facades. Thomas contributed to the chapter about tactical design which explores facades.
- The master minds [Zack Jackson](https://twitter.com/ScriptedAlchemy) and [Jack Herrington](https://twitter.com/jherr) helped me to understand the API for Dynamic Module Federation.
- The awesome [Tobias Koppers](https://twitter.com/wSokra) gave me valuable insights into this topic and 
- The one and only [Dmitriy Shekhovtsov](https://twitter.com/valorkin) helped me using the Angular CLI/webpack 5 integration for this.
